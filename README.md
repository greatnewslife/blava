# Blava

Performant artful blob generator using canvas ðŸ“‹

## Install

Via npm, Yarn, pnpm

```bash
pnpm i blava
```

## How to use

1. Import with

   `import { Blava, Point } from 'blava';`

2. Place a blank canvas element into a parent container. The canvas will be resized to cover the parent element, which is assumed to be square in aspect ratio
3. Initialize the Blava object with `new Blava(canvas)` where `canvas` is a reference to the canvas element. An additional configuration object can also be included. Animation automatically begins. To toggle the animation, call `Blava.pause` and `Blava.play`

## Other notes

### Canvas coordinates & animation

A Blava is generated on a canvas whose container element is assumed to be a square. Points are placed on a 100Ã—100 grid, with `{x: 0, y: 0}` being the top left corner of the canvas. The `variance` setting determines the maximum distance the point can travel vertically or horizontally during animation (assuming the Point's `animated` property for that dimension is set to `true`)

### Points

A custom `Point` class is included to track positioning and per-direction animation state of each point in the Blava. The constructor takes an `x` and `y` position as well as an optional configuration object. The configuration object can have an `animated` property with either a boolean to determine whether the Point is animated at all or an object with `x` and `y` properties to set animation state per dimension

### Hooks

The `beforePaint` and `afterPaint` configuration options allow for a function before and after the
Blava paint operation respectively. Both functions have full access to the Blava instance as the
first passed argument. Point calculation is completed before running either function, so they can
be manipulated before or after the paint operation.
