# About Us

At GreatNews.Life, we take a new, positive approach to online publishing that creates new opportunities to spread good news about communities.

We don't create websites. We create online communities large enough to support major advertising, but small enough to remain hyper-local.

## Contributing

For the most part Blava is considered feature-complete. However, if you'd like to submit a bug, update the docs, or contribute a framework-specific component, [open an issue on our repo](https://github.com/greatnewslife/blava/issues)!
