# Getting Started

Install with npm, Yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
pnpm i blava
```

Blava requires only a canvas element to begin. To avoid stretching, use a canvas with a 1Ã—1 aspect ratio as Blava assumes a square

```javascript
new Blava(document.querySelector("canvas"));
```

A host of configuration options allow for customization of the generated graphics, though none are required to get a basic Blava running.

```javascript
new Blava(c, {
  //One of "wave" or "blob"
  style: "blob",

  //Amount of animated points on the chosen Blava style
  pointCount: 5,

  //Specify the ends of the linear gradients
  gradient: {
    from: "#1fc",
    to: "#9ff",
  },

  //One of ["molasses", "slow", "medium", "fast", "jelly"] or
  //a number. The higher the number, the more rapid the
  //movement
  movementSpeed: "slow",
});
```
